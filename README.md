# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to find the school data for Thomas High School. Since there were signs of academic dishonesty in their 9th greade class, we altered the data to not include 9th graders test scores for reading and math and then repeated the analysis of their data.
